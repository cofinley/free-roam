# Free-roam

Currently a work in progress. See [issues](https://github.com/cofinley/free-roam/issues) for work left to do.

## What

A [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) clone. One that is:

- free
- offline
- not a cult

## Why

- I wanted to learn React
- I don't like apps which slap on cloud storage to justify SaaS monthly pricing models
- "That doesn't sound too difficult" famous last words

## Notes

See current releases to try it out. Just download the bundle, unzip, open the `index.html` and enjoy! Save and load your data in-between sessions.

I'm still figuring out best ways to do this without delving into React Native/Electron but it may come to that for less friction on saving/backing up.

For now, it's the user's job to save their data, but the app will also warn on tab/window close in case there is unsaved work.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
